## Description

With the Bar Finders! application, you can find the nearest bars or restaurants in a matter of seconds based on our current location, and you can also indicate the maximum distance at which you want these bars or restaurants to appear. Additionally, we can automatically store in a list the bars that were available when we last used the application, as they will be saved in a database. We can also search by name among the bars that have appeared to us previously on the map.

Thanks to Bar Finders!, we will save time by not having to filter the type of place we want to search for, as it focuses exclusively on bars or restaurants.
